/**
 * Trait providing class <code>Checkpoint</code>, which enables multiple assertions
 * to be performed within a test, with any failures accumulated and reported
 * together at the end of the test.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because ScalaTest uses exceptions to signal failed assertions, normally execution
 * of a test will stop as soon as the first failed assertion is encountered. Trait
 * <code>Checkpoints</code> provides an option when you want to continue executing
 * the remainder of the test body, or part of it, even if an assertion has already failed in that test.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use a <code>Checkpoint</code> (once you've mixed in or imported the members of trait
 * <code>Checkpoints</code>), you first need to create one, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * val cp = new Checkpoint
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Then give the <code>Checkpoint</code> assertions to execute by passing them (via a by-name parameter)
 * to its <code>apply</code> method, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * val (x, y) = (1, 2)
 * cp { x should be &lt; 0 }
 * cp { y should be &gt; 9 }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both of the above assertions will fail, but it won't be reported yet. The <code>Checkpoint</code> will execute them
 * right away, each time its <code>apply</code> method is invoked. But it will catch the <code>TestFailedExceptions</code> and
 * save them, only reporting them later when <code>reportAll</code> is invoked. Thus, at the end of the test, you must call
 * <code>reportAll</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * cp.reportAll()
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This <code>reportAll</code> invocation will complete abruptly with a <code>TestFailedException</code> whose message
 * includes the message, source file, and line number of each of the checkpointed assertions that previously failed. For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1 was not less than 0 (in Checkpoint) at ExampleSpec.scala:12
 * 2 was not greater than 9 (in Checkpoint) at ExampleSpec.scala:13
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Make sure you invoke <code>reportAll</code> before the test completes, otherwise any failures that were detected by the
 * <code>Checkpoint</code> will not be reported.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that a <code>Checkpoint</code> will catch and record for later reporting (via <code>reportAll</code>) exceptions that mix in <code>StackDepth</code>
 * except for <code>TestCanceledException</code>, <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>, <code>NotAllowedException</code>,
 * and <code>DuplicateTestNameException</code>. If a block of code passed to a <code>Checkpoint</code>'s <code>apply</code> method completes
 * abruptly with any of the <code>StackDepth</code> exceptions in the previous list, or any non-<code>StackDepth</code> exception, that invocation
 * of the <code>apply</code> method will complete abruptly with the same exception immediately. Unless you put <code>reportAll</code> in a finally
 * clause and handle this case, such an unexpected exception will cause you to lose any information about assertions that failed earlier in the test and were
 * recorded by the <code>Checkpoint</code>.
