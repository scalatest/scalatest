/**
 * A suite of tests in which each test represents one <em>scenario</em> of a <em>feature</em>. 
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code> is intended for writing tests that are "higher level" than unit tests, for example, integration
 * tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests. You can use <code>FeatureSpec</code> for unit testing if you prefer, however.
 * 
 * <table><tr><td class="usage">
 * <strong>Recommended Usage</strong>:
 * Class <code>FeatureSpec</code> is primarily intended for acceptance testing, including facilitating the process of programmers working alongside non-programmers to
 * define the acceptance requirements.
 * </td></tr></table>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although not required, <code>FeatureSpec</code> is often used together with <a href="GivenWhenThen.html"><code>GivenWhenThen</code></a> to express acceptance requirements
 * in more detail. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="initialExample"></a>
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec
 * 
 * import org.scalatest._
 * 
 * class TVSet {
 *   private var on: Boolean = false
 *   def isOn: Boolean = on
 *   def pressPowerButton() {
 *     on = !on
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class TVSetSpec extends FeatureSpec with GivenWhenThen {
 * 
 *   info("As a TV set owner")
 *   info("I want to be able to turn the TV on and off")
 *   info("So I can watch TV when I want")
 *   info("And save energy when I'm not watching TV")
 * 
 *   feature("TV power button") {
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is off") {
 * 
 *       Given("a TV set that is switched off")
 *       val tv = new TVSet
 *       assert(!tv.isOn)
 * 
 *       When("the power button is pressed")
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 * 
 *       Then("the TV should switch on")

 *     }
 *     
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is on") {
 * 
 *       Given("a TV set that is switched on")
 *       val tv = new TVSet
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(tv.isOn)
 * 
 *       When("the power button is pressed")
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 * 
 *       Then("the TV should switch off")
 *       assert(!tv.isOn)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: for more information on the calls to <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>, and <code>Then</code>, see the documentation 
 * for trait <a href="GivenWhenThen.html"><code>GivenWhenThen</code></a> and the <a href="#informers"><code>Informers</code> section</a> below.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FeatureSpec</code> contains <em>feature clauses</em> and <em>scenarios</em>. You define a feature clause
 * with <code>feature</code>, and a scenario with <code>scenario</code>. Both
 * <code>feature</code> and <code>scenario</code> are methods, defined in
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code>, which will be invoked
 * by the primary constructor of <code>TVSetSpec</code>. 
 * A feature clause describes a feature of the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
 * and testing. In the previous example, 
 * the subject under specification and test is a TV set. The feature being specified and tested is 
 * the behavior of a TV set when its power button is pressed. With each scenario you provide a
 * string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies the behavior of the subject for
 * one scenario in which the feature may be used, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
 * You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
 * braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
 * <code>scenario</code>, which will register the test for later execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
 * <em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
 * <code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Scenarios can only be registered with the <code>scenario</code> method while the <code>FeatureSpec</code> is
 * in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a scenario after the <code>FeatureSpec</code> has
 * entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>FeatureSpec</code>,
 * will be met with a thrown <a href="exceptions/TestRegistrationClosedException.html"><code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code></a>. The recommended style
 * of using <code>FeatureSpec</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
 * the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
 * <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each scenario represents one test. The name of the test is the spec text passed to the <code>scenario</code> method.
 * The feature name does not appear as part of the test name. In a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, therefore, you must take care
 * to ensure that each test has a unique name (in other words, that each <code>scenario</code> has unique spec text).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When you run a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, it will send <a href="events/Formatter.html"><code>Formatter</code></a>s in the events it sends to the
 * <a href="Reporter.html"><code>Reporter</code></a>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these events in such a way
 * that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the <em>subject</em> being tested.
 * For example, were you to run <code>TVSetSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new TVSetSpec)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You would see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">TVSetSpec:
 * As a TV set owner 
 * I want to be able to turn the TV on and off 
 * So I can watch TV when I want 
 * And save energy when I'm not watching TV 
 * Feature: TV power button
 *   Scenario: User presses power button when TV is off
 *     Given a TV set that is switched off 
 *     When the power button is pressed 
 *     Then the TV should switch on 
 *   Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on
 *     Given a TV set that is switched on 
 *     When the power button is pressed 
 *     Then the TV should switch off</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or, to run just the &ldquo;<code>Feature: TV power button Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on</code>&rdquo; method, you could pass that test's name, or any unique substring of the
 * name, such as <code>"TV is on"</code>. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new TVSetSpec, "TV is on")
 * <span class="stGreen">TVSetSpec:
 * As a TV set owner 
 * I want to be able to turn the TV on and off 
 * So I can watch TV when I want 
 * And save energy when I'm not watching TV 
 * Feature: TV power button
 *   Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on
 *     Given a TV set that is switched on 
 *     When the power button is pressed 
 *     Then the TV should switch off</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Note: Trait <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s syntax is in part inspired by <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a>, a Ruby BDD framework.</em>
 *</p>
 *
 * <a name="ignoredTests"></a><h2>Ignored tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support the common use case of temporarily disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>FeatureSpec</code> provides registration
 * methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>scenario</code>. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test named <code>addition</code>, just change &ldquo;<code>scenario</code>&rdquo; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.ignore
 * 
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * 
 * class TVSet {
 *   private var on: Boolean = false
 *   def isOn: Boolean = on
 *   def pressPowerButton() {
 *     on = !on
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class TVSetSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   feature("TV power button") {
 *     ignore("User presses power button when TV is off") {
 *       val tv = new TVSet
 *       assert(!tv.isOn)
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(tv.isOn)
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is on") {
 *       val tv = new TVSet
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(tv.isOn)
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(!tv.isOn)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>SetSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new TVSetSpec)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only the second scenario and report that the first scenario was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">TVSetSpec:
 * Feature: TV power button</span>
 *   <span class="stYellow">Scenario: User presses power button when TV is off !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
 *   <span class="stGreen">Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <a name="informers"></a><h2>Informers</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the parameters to <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
 * will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
 * Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed, 
 * and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <a href="Reporter.html"><code>Reporter</code></a> as the suite runs.
 * Most often the default reporting done by <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
 * occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
 * For this purpose, an <a href="Informer.html"><code>Informer</code></a> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
 * is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
 * You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via its <code>apply</code> method.
 * The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <a href="events/InfoProvided.html"><code>InfoProvided</code></a> event.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One use case for the <code>Informer</code> is to pass more information about a scenario to the reporter. For example,
 * the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait provides methods that use the implicit <code>info</code> provided by <code>FeatureSpec</code>
 * to pass such information to the reporter. You can see this in action in the <a href="#initialExample">initial example</a> of this trait's documentation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="documenters"></a><h2>Documenters</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code> also provides a <code>markup</code> method that returns a <a href="Documenter.html"><code>Documenter</code></a>, which allows you to send
 * to the <code>Reporter</code> text formatted in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown syntax</a>.
 * You can pass the extra information to the <code>Documenter</code> via its <code>apply</code> method.
 * The <code>Documenter</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <a href="events/MarkupProvided.html"><code>MarkupProvided</code></a> event.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's an example <code>FlatSpec</code> that uses <code>markup</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.markup
 *
 * import collection.mutable
 * import org.scalatest._
 *
 * class SetSpec extends FeatureSpec with GivenWhenThen {
 *
 *   markup { """
 *
 * Mutable Set
 * -----------
 *
 * A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.
 *
 * To implement a concrete mutable set, you need to provide implementations
 * of the following methods:
 *
 *     def contains(elem: A): Boolean
 *     def iterator: Iterator[A]
 *     def += (elem: A): this.type
 *     def -= (elem: A): this.type

 * If you wish that methods like `take`,
 * `drop`, `filter` return the same kind of set,
 * you should also override:
 *
 *      def empty: This

 * It is also good idea to override methods `foreach` and
 * `size` for efficiency.
 *
 *   """ }
 *
 *   feature("An element can be added to an empty mutable Set") {
 *     scenario("When an element is added to an empty mutable Set") {
 *       Given("an empty mutable Set")
 *       val set = mutable.Set.empty[String]
 *
 *       When("an element is added")
 *       set += "clarity"
 *
 *       Then("the Set should have size 1")
 *       assert(set.size === 1)
 *
 *       And("the Set should contain the added element")
 *       assert(set.contains("clarity"))
 *
 *       markup("This test finished with a **bold** statement!")
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although all of ScalaTest's built-in reporters will display the markup text in some form,
 * the HTML reporter will format the markup information into HTML. Thus, the main purpose of <code>markup</code> is to
 * add nicely formatted text to HTML reports. Here's what the above <code>SetSpec</code> would look like in the HTML reporter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <img class="stScreenShot" src="../../lib/featureSpec.gif">
 *
 * <a name="notifiersAlerters"></a><h2>Notifiers and alerters</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * ScalaTest records text passed to <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> during tests, and sends the recorded text in the <code>recordedEvents</code> field of
 * test completion events like <code>TestSucceeded</code> and <code>TestFailed</code>. This allows string reporters (like the standard out reporter) to show
 * <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> text <em>after</em> the test name in a color determined by the outcome of the test. For example, if the test fails, string
 * reporters will show the <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> text in red. If a test succeeds, string reporters will show the <code>info</code>
 * and <code>markup</code> text in green. While this approach helps the readability of reports, it means that you can't use <code>info</code> to get status
 * updates from long running tests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To get immediate (<em>i.e.</em>, non-recorded) notifications from tests, you can use <code>note</code> (a <a href="Notifier.html"><code>Notifier</code></a>) and <code>alert</code>
 * (an <a href="Alerter.html"><code>Alerter</code></a>). Here's an example showing the differences:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.note
 *
 * import collection.mutable
 * import org.scalatest._
 *
 * class SetSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   feature("An element can be added to an empty mutable Set") {
 *     scenario("When an element is added to an empty mutable Set") {
 *
 *       info("info is recorded")
 *       markup("markup is *also* recorded")
 *       note("notes are sent immediately")
 *       alert("alerts are also sent immediately")
 *
 *       val set = mutable.Set.empty[String]
 *       set += "clarity"
 *       assert(set.size === 1)
 *       assert(set.contains("clarity"))
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because <code>note</code> and <code>alert</code> information is sent immediately, it will appear <em>before</em> the test name in string reporters, and its color will
 * be unrelated to the ultimate outcome of the test: <code>note</code> text will always appear in green, <code>alert</code> text will always appear in yellow.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new SetSpec)
 * <span class="stGreen">SetSpec:
 * Feature: An element can be added to an empty mutable Set
 *   + notes are sent immediately</span>
 *   <span class="stYellow">+ alerts are also sent immediately</span>
 *   <span class="stGreen">Scenario: When an element is added to an empty mutable Set
 *     info is recorded
 *   + markup is *also* recorded</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In summary, use <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> for text that should form part of the specification output. Use
 * <code>note</code> and <code>alert</code> to send status notifications. (Because the HTML reporter is intended to produce a
 * readable, printable specification, <code>info</code> and <code>markup</code> text will appear in the HTML report, but
 * <code>note</code> and <code>alert</code> text will not.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="pendingTests"></a><h2>Pending tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <a href="exceptions/TestPendingException.html"><code>TestPendingException</code></a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
 * You can mark tests as pending in a <code>FeatureSpec</code> like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.pending
 * 
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * 
 * class TVSet {
 *   private var on: Boolean = false
 *   def isOn: Boolean = on
 *   def pressPowerButton() {
 *     on = !on
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class TVSetSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   feature("TV power button") {
 *
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is off") (pending)
 *
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is on") {
 *       val tv = new TVSet
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(tv.isOn)
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(!tv.isOn)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: "<code>(pending)</code>" is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
 * of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
 * If you run this version of <code>TVSetSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new TVSetSpec)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run both tests, but report that <code>When empty should have size 0</code> is pending. You'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">TVSetSpec:
 * Feature: TV power button</span>
 *   <span class="stYellow">Scenario: User presses power button when TV is off (pending)</span>
 *   <span class="stGreen">Scenario: User presses power button when TV is on</span>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One difference between an ignored test and a pending one is that an ignored test is intended to be used during a
 * significant refactorings of the code under test, when tests break and you don't want to spend the time to fix
 * all of them immediately. You can mark some of those broken tests as ignored temporarily, so that you can focus the red
 * bar on just failing tests you actually want to fix immediately. Later you can go back and fix the ignored tests.
 * In other words, by ignoring some failing tests temporarily, you can more easily notice failed tests that you actually
 * want to fix. By contrast, a pending test is intended to be used before a test and/or the code under test is written.
 * Pending indicates you've decided to write a test for a bit of behavior, but either you haven't written the test yet, or
 * have only written part of it, or perhaps you've written the test but don't want to implement the behavior it tests
 * until after you've implemented a different bit of behavior you realized you need first. Thus ignored tests are designed
 * to facilitate refactoring of existing code whereas pending tests are designed to facilitate the creation of new code.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One other difference between ignored and pending tests is that ignored tests are implemented as a test tag that is
 * excluded by default. Thus an ignored test is never executed. By contrast, a pending test is implemented as a
 * test that throws <code>TestPendingException</code> (which is what calling the <code>pending</code> method does). Thus
 * the body of pending tests are executed up until they throw <code>TestPendingException</code>. The reason for this difference
 * is that it enables your unfinished test to send <code>InfoProvided</code> messages to the reporter before it completes
 * abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>, as shown in the previous example on <code>Informer</code>s
 * that used the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait. For example, the following snippet in a <code>FeatureSpec</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.infopending
 * 
 * import org.scalatest._
 * 
 * class TVSet {
 *   private var on: Boolean = false
 * 
 *   def isOn: Boolean = on
 * 
 *   def pressPowerButton() {
 *     on = !on
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class TVSetSpec extends FeatureSpec with GivenWhenThen {
 * 
 *   info("As a TV set owner")
 *   info("I want to be able to turn the TV on and off")
 *   info("So I can watch TV when I want")
 *   info("And save energy when I'm not watching TV")
 * 
 *   feature("TV power button") {
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is off") {
 *       Given("a TV that is switched off")
 *       When("the power button is pressed")
 *       Then("the TV should switch on")
 *       pending
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is on") {
 *       Given("a TV that is switched on")
 *       When("the power button is pressed")
 *       Then("the TV should switch off")
 *       pending
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Would yield the following output when run in the interpreter:
 * </p>
 *

 * <a name="taggingTests"></a><h2>Tagging tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s tests,
 * you pass objects that extend class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to methods
 * that register tests. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter, a string name.  If you have
 * created tag annotation interfaces as described in the <a href="Tag.html"><code>Tag</code> documentation</a>, then you
 * will probably want to use tag names on your test functions that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the tag interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined a tag annotation interface with fully qualified name, 
 * <code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code>, then you could
 * create a matching tag for <code>FeatureSpec</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.tagging
 * 
 * import org.scalatest.Tag
 * 
 * object DbTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.tags.DbTest")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could place <code>FeatureSpec</code> tests into groups with tags like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import org.scalatest.tagobjects.Slow
 * 
 * class TVSet {
 *   private var on: Boolean = false
 *   def isOn: Boolean = on
 *   def pressPowerButton() {

 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class TVSetSpec extends FeatureSpec {

 *       assert(!tv.isOn)
 *       tv.pressPowerButton()
 *       assert(tv.isOn)
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("User presses power button when TV is on", Slow, DbTest) {

 * The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
 * <code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
 * except those those belonging to tags listed in the
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
 * belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
 * will be run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is recommended, though not required, that you create a corresponding tag annotation when you
 * create a <code>Tag</code> object. A tag annotation (on the JVM, not Scala.js) allows you to tag all the tests of a <code>FeatureSpec</code> in
 * one stroke by annotating the class. For more information and examples, see the
 * <a href="Tag.html">documentation for class <code>Tag</code></a>. On Scala.js, to tag all tests of a suite, you'll need to
 * tag each test individually at the test site.

 * <h2>Shared fixtures</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is composed of the objects and other artifacts (files, sockets, database
 * connections, <em>etc.</em>) tests use to do their work.
 * When multiple tests need to work with the same fixtures, it is important to try and avoid
 * duplicating the fixture code across those tests. The more code duplication you have in your
 * tests, the greater drag the tests will have on refactoring the actual production code.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ScalaTest recommends three techniques to eliminate such code duplication:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Refactor using Scala</li>
 * <li>Override <code>withFixture</code></li>
 * <li>Mix in a <em>before-and-after</em> trait</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each technique is geared towards helping you reduce code duplication without introducing
 * instance <code>var</code>s, shared mutable objects, or other dependencies between tests. Eliminating shared
 * mutable state across tests will make your test code easier to reason about and more amenable for parallel
 * test execution.</p><p>The following sections
 * describe these techniques, including explaining the recommended usage
 * for each. But first, here's a table summarizing the options:</p>

 * <a name="getFixtureMethods"></a>
 * <h4>Calling get-fixture methods</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you need to create the same mutable fixture objects in multiple tests, and don't need to clean them up after using them, the simplest approach is to write one or
 * more <em>get-fixture</em> methods. A get-fixture method returns a new instance of a needed fixture object (or a holder object containing
 * multiple fixture objects) each time it is called. You can call a get-fixture method at the beginning of each
 * test that needs the fixture, storing the returned object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.getfixture
 * 
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   class Fixture {
 *     val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is designed to ")
 *     val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *   }
 *  
 *   def fixture = new Fixture
 *  
 *   feature("Simplicity") {
 *     scenario("User needs to read test code written by others") {
 *       val f = fixture
 *       f.builder.append("encourage clear code!")
 *       assert(f.builder.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to encourage clear code!")
 *       assert(f.buffer.isEmpty)
 *       f.buffer += "sweet"
 *     }
 *   
 *     scenario("User needs to understand what the tests are doing") {
 *       val f = fixture
 *       f.builder.append("be easy to reason about!")
 *       assert(f.builder.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to be easy to reason about!")
 *       assert(f.buffer.isEmpty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The &ldquo;<code>f.</code>&rdquo; in front of each use of a fixture object provides a visual indication of which objects 
 * are part of the fixture, but if you prefer, you can import the the members with &ldquo;<code>import f._</code>&rdquo; and use the names directly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you need to configure fixture objects differently in different tests, you can pass configuration into the get-fixture method. For example, you could pass
 * in an initial value for a mutable fixture object as a parameter to the get-fixture method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="fixtureContextObjects"></a>
 * <h4>Instantiating fixture-context objects </h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * An alternate technique that is especially useful when different tests need different combinations of fixture objects is to define the fixture objects as instance variables
 * of <em>fixture-context objects</em> whose instantiation forms the body of tests. Like get-fixture methods, fixture-context objects are only
 * appropriate if you don't need to clean up the fixtures after using them.
 * </p>
 *
 * To use this technique, you define instance variables intialized with fixture objects in traits and/or classes, then in each test instantiate an object that
 * contains just the fixture objects needed by the test. Traits allow you to mix together just the fixture objects needed by each test, whereas classes
 * allow you to pass data in via a constructor to configure the fixture objects. Here's an example in which fixture objects are partitioned into two traits
 * and each test just mixes together the traits it needs:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.fixturecontext
 * 
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   trait Builder {
 *     val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is designed to ")
 *   }
 * 
 *   trait Buffer {
 *     val buffer = ListBuffer("ScalaTest", "is", "designed", "to")
 *   }
 * 
 *   feature("Simplicity") {
 *     // This test needs the StringBuilder fixture
 *     scenario("User needs to read test code written by others") {
 *       new Builder {
 *         builder.append("encourage clear code!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to encourage clear code!")
 *       }
 *     }
 *     
 *     // This test needs the ListBuffer[String] fixture
 *     scenario("User needs to understand what the tests are doing") {
 *       new Buffer {
 *         buffer += ("be", "easy", "to", "reason", "about!")
 *         assert(buffer === List("ScalaTest", "is", "designed", "to", "be", "easy", "to", "reason", "about!"))
 *       }
 *     }
 * 
 *     // This test needs both the StringBuilder and ListBuffer
 *     scenario("User needs to write tests") {
 *       new Builder with Buffer {
 *         builder.append("be easy to learn!")
 *         buffer += ("be", "easy", "to", "remember", "how", "to", "write!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to be easy to learn!")
 *         assert(buffer === List("ScalaTest", "is", "designed", "to", "be", "easy",
 *           "to", "remember", "how", "to", "write!"))
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }

 *
 * <a name="withFixtureNoArgTest"></a>
 * <h4>Overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code></h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the get-fixture method and fixture-context object approaches take care of setting up a fixture at the beginning of each
 * test, they don't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture at the end of the test. If you just need to perform a side-effect at the beginning or end of
 * a test, and don't need to actually pass any fixture objects into the test, you can override <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>, one of ScalaTest's
 * lifecycle methods defined in trait <a href="Suite.html"><code>Suite</code></a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Trait <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of <code>runTest</code> passes a no-arg test function to <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>. It is <code>withFixture</code>'s
 * responsibility to invoke that test function. <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of <code>withFixture</code> simply
 * invokes the function, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * // Default implementation in trait Suite
 * protected def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) = {
 *   test()
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can, therefore, override <code>withFixture</code> to perform setup before and/or cleanup after invoking the test function. If
 * you have cleanup to perform, you should invoke the test function inside a <code>try</code> block and perform the cleanup in
 * a <code>finally</code> clause, in case an exception propagates back through <code>withFixture</code>. (If a test fails because of an exception,
 * the test function invoked by withFixture will result in a [[org.scalatest.Failed <code>Failed</code>]] wrapping the exception. Nevertheless,
 * best practice is to perform cleanup in a finally clause just in case an exception occurs.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>withFixture</code> method is designed to be stacked, and to enable this, you should always call the <code>super</code> implementation
 * of <code>withFixture</code>, and let it invoke the test function rather than invoking the test function directly. That is to say, instead of writing
 * &ldquo;<code>test()</code>&rdquo;, you should write &ldquo;<code>super.withFixture(test)</code>&rdquo;, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * // Your implementation
 * override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) = {
 *   // Perform setup
 *   try super.withFixture(test) // Invoke the test function
 *   finally {
 *     // Perform cleanup
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's an example in which <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> is used to take a snapshot of the working directory if a test fails, and 
 * send that information to the reporter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.noargtest
 * 
 * import java.io.File
 * import org.scalatest._
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) = {
 * 
 *     super.withFixture(test) match {
 *       case failed: Failed =&gt;
 *         val currDir = new File(".")
 *         val fileNames = currDir.list()
 *         info("Dir snapshot: " + fileNames.mkString(", "))
 *         failed
 *       case other =&gt; other
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   scenario("This scenario should succeed") {
 *     assert(1 + 1 === 2)
 *   }
 * 
 *   scenario("This scenario should fail") {
 *     assert(1 + 1 === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Running this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> in the interpreter in a directory with two files, <code>hello.txt</code> and <code>world.txt</code>
 * would give the following output:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; org.scalatest.run(new ExampleSpec)
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSpec:
 * Scenario: This scenario should succeed</span>
 * <span class="stRed">Scenario: This scenario should fail *** FAILED ***
 *   2 did not equal 3 (<console>:115)
 *   + Dir snapshot: hello.txt, world.txt </span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the <a href="Suite$NoArgTest.html"><code>NoArgTest</code></a> passed to <code>withFixture</code>, in addition to
 * an <code>apply</code> method that executes the test, also includes the test name and the <a href="ConfigMap.html">config
 * map</a> passed to <code>runTest</code>. Thus you can also use the test name and configuration objects in your <code>withFixture</code>
 * implementation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="loanFixtureMethods"></a>
 * <h4>Calling loan-fixture methods</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you need to both pass a fixture object into a test <em>and</em> perform cleanup at the end of the test, you'll need to use the <em>loan pattern</em>.
 * If different tests need different fixtures that require cleanup, you can implement the loan pattern directly by writing <em>loan-fixture</em> methods.
 * A loan-fixture method takes a function whose body forms part or all of a test's code. It creates a fixture, passes it to the test code by invoking the
 * function, then cleans up the fixture after the function returns.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following example shows three tests that use two fixtures, a database and a file. Both require cleanup after, so each is provided via a
 * loan-fixture method. (In this example, the database is simulated with a <code>StringBuffer</code>.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.loanfixture
 * 
 * import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap
 * 
 * object DbServer { // Simulating a database server
 *   type Db = StringBuffer
 *   private val databases = new ConcurrentHashMap[String, Db]
 *   def createDb(name: String): Db = {
 *     val db = new StringBuffer
 *     databases.put(name, db)
 *     db
 *   }
 *   def removeDb(name: String) {
 *     databases.remove(name)
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import DbServer._
 * import java.util.UUID.randomUUID
 * import java.io._
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   def withDatabase(testCode: Db =&gt; Any) {
 *     val dbName = randomUUID.toString
 *     val db = createDb(dbName) // create the fixture
 *     try {
 *       db.append("ScalaTest is designed to ") // perform setup
 *       testCode(db) // "loan" the fixture to the test
 *     }
 *     finally removeDb(dbName) // clean up the fixture
 *   }
 * 
 *   def withFile(testCode: (File, FileWriter) =&gt; Any) {
 *     val file = File.createTempFile("hello", "world") // create the fixture
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(file)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("ScalaTest is designed to ") // set up the fixture
 *       testCode(file, writer) // "loan" the fixture to the test
 *     }
 *     finally writer.close() // clean up the fixture
 *   }
 * 
 *   feature("Simplicity") {
 *     // This test needs the file fixture
 *     scenario("User needs to read test code written by others") {
 *       withFile { (file, writer) =&gt;
 *         writer.write("encourage clear code!")
 *         writer.flush()
 *         assert(file.length === 46)
 *       }
 *     }
 *     // This test needs the database fixture
 *     scenario("User needs to understand what the tests are doing") {
 *       withDatabase { db =&gt;
 *         db.append("be easy to reason about!")
 *         assert(db.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to be easy to reason about!")
 *       }
 *     }
 *     // This test needs both the file and the database
 *     scenario("User needs to write tests") {
 *       withDatabase { db =&gt;
 *         withFile { (file, writer) =&gt; // loan-fixture methods compose
 *           db.append("be easy to learn!")
 *           writer.write("be easy to remember how to write!")
 *           writer.flush()
 *           assert(db.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to be easy to learn!")
 *           assert(file.length === 58)
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * As demonstrated by the last test, loan-fixture methods compose. Not only do loan-fixture methods allow you to
 * give each test the fixture it needs, they allow you to give a test multiple fixtures and clean everything up afterwards.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Also demonstrated in this example is the technique of giving each test its own "fixture sandbox" to play in. When your fixtures
 * involve external side-effects, like creating files or databases, it is a good idea to give each file or database a unique name as is
 * done in this example. This keeps tests completely isolated, allowing you to run them in parallel if desired.
 * </p>
 *
 * </pre>
 * <a name="withFixtureOneArgTest"></a>
 * <h4>Overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code></h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * If all or most tests need the same fixture, you can avoid some of the boilerplate of the loan-fixture method approach by using a <a href="fixture/FeatureSpec.html"><code>fixture.FeatureSpec</code></a>
 * and overriding <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code>.
 * Each test in a <code>fixture.FeatureSpec</code> takes a fixture as a parameter, allowing you to pass the fixture into
 * the test. You must indicate the type of the fixture parameter by specifying <code>FixtureParam</code>, and implement a
 * <code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>. This <code>withFixture</code> method is responsible for
 * invoking the one-arg test function, so you can perform fixture set up before, and clean up after, invoking and passing
 * the fixture into the test function.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To enable the stacking of traits that define <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>, it is a good idea to let
 * <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> invoke the test function instead of invoking the test
 * function directly. To do so, you'll need to convert the <code>OneArgTest</code> to a <code>NoArgTest</code>. You can do that by passing
 * the fixture object to the <code>toNoArgTest</code> method of <code>OneArgTest</code>. In other words, instead of
 * writing &ldquo;<code>test(theFixture)</code>&rdquo;, you'd delegate responsibility for
 * invoking the test function to the <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> method of the same instance by writing:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * withFixture(test.toNoArgTest(theFixture))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's a complete example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.oneargtest
 * 
 * import org.scalatest.fixture
 * import java.io._
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends fixture.FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   case class FixtureParam(file: File, writer: FileWriter)
 * 
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) = {
 * 
 *     // create the fixture
 *     val file = File.createTempFile("hello", "world")
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(file)
 *     val theFixture = FixtureParam(file, writer)
 * 
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("ScalaTest is designed to be ") // set up the fixture
 *       withFixture(test.toNoArgTest(theFixture)) // "loan" the fixture to the test
 *     }
 *     finally writer.close() // clean up the fixture
 *   }
 * 
 *   feature("Simplicity") {
 *     scenario("User needs to read test code written by others") { f =&gt;
 *       f.writer.write("encourage clear code!")
 *       f.writer.flush()
 *       assert(f.file.length === 49)
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("User needs to understand what the tests are doing") { f =&gt;
 *       f.writer.write("be easy to reason about!")
 *       f.writer.flush()
 *       assert(f.file.length === 52)
 *     }
 *   } 
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the tests actually required two fixture objects, a <code>File</code> and a <code>FileWriter</code>. In such situations you can
 * simply define the <code>FixtureParam</code> type to be a tuple containing the objects, or as is done in this example, a case class containing
 * the objects.  For more information on the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> technique, see the <a href="fixture/FeatureSpec.html">documentation for <code>fixture.FeatureSpec</code></a>.

 * In all the shared fixture examples shown so far, the activities of creating, setting up, and cleaning up the fixture objects have been
 * performed <em>during</em> the test.  This means that if an exception occurs during any of these activities, it will be reported as a test failure.
 * Sometimes, however, you may want setup to happen <em>before</em> the test starts, and cleanup <em>after</em> the test has completed, so that if an
 * exception occurs during setup or cleanup, the entire suite aborts and no more tests are attempted. The simplest way to accomplish this in ScalaTest is
 * to mix in trait <a href="BeforeAndAfter.html"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a>.  With this trait you can denote a bit of code to run before each test
 * with <code>before</code> and/or after each test each test with <code>after</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.beforeandafter
 * 
 * import org.scalatest._
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends FeatureSpec with BeforeAndAfter {
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   before {
 *     builder.append("ScalaTest is designed to ")
 *   }
 *

 *     scenario("User needs to read test code written by others") {
 *       builder.append("encourage clear code!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is designed to encourage clear code!")
 *       assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *       buffer += "sweet"
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("User needs to understand what the tests are doing") {

 *       assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the only way <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> code can communicate with test code is via some side-effecting mechanism, commonly by
 * reassigning instance <code>var</code>s or by changing the state of mutable objects held from instance <code>val</code>s (as in this example). If using
 * instance <code>var</code>s or mutable objects held from instance <code>val</code>s you wouldn't be able to run tests in parallel in the same instance
 * of the test class (on the JVM, not Scala.js) unless you synchronized access to the shared, mutable state. This is why ScalaTest's <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> trait extends
 * <a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>. By running each test in its own instance of the class, each test has its own copy of the instance variables, so you
 * don't need to synchronize. If you mixed <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> into the <code>ExampleSuite</code> above, the tests would run in parallel just fine
 * without any synchronization needed on the mutable <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>ListBuffer[String]</code> objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> provides a minimal-boilerplate way to execute code before and after tests, it isn't designed to enable stackable
 * traits, because the order of execution would be non-obvious.  If you want to factor out before and after code that is common to multiple test suites, you 
 * should use trait <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> instead, as shown later in the next section,
 * <a href="#composingFixtures.html">composing fixtures by stacking traits</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="composingFixtures"></a><h2>Composing fixtures by stacking traits</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * In larger projects, teams often end up with several different fixtures that test classes need in different combinations,
 * and possibly initialized (and cleaned up) in different orders. A good way to accomplish this in ScalaTest is to factor the individual
 * fixtures into traits that can be composed using the <em>stackable trait</em> pattern. This can be done, for example, by placing
 * <code>withFixture</code> methods in several traits, each of which call <code>super.withFixture</code>. Here's an example in
 * which the <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>ListBuffer[String]</code> fixtures used in the previous examples have been
 * factored out into two <em>stackable fixture traits</em> named <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">

 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * By mixing in both the <code>Builder</code> and <code>Buffer</code> traits, <code>ExampleSuite</code> gets both fixtures, which will be
 * initialized before each test and cleaned up after. The order the traits are mixed together determines the order of execution.
 * In this case, <code>Builder</code> is &ldquo;super&rdquo; to <code>Buffer</code>. If you wanted <code>Buffer</code> to be &ldquo;super&rdquo;
 * to <code>Builder</code>, you need only switch the order you mix them together, like this: 
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class Example2Spec extends FeatureSpec with Buffer with Builder
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * And if you only need one fixture you mix in only that trait:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class Example3Spec extends FeatureSpec with Builder
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another way to create stackable fixture traits is by extending the <a href="BeforeAndAfterEach.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code></a>
 * and/or <a href="BeforeAndAfterAll.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code></a> traits.
 * <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> has a <code>beforeEach</code> method that will be run before each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>),
 * and an <code>afterEach</code> method that will be run after (like JUnit's <code>tearDown</code>).
 * Similarly, <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> has a <code>beforeAll</code> method that will be run before all tests,
 * and an <code>afterAll</code> method that will be run after all tests. Here's what the previously shown example would look like if it
 * were rewritten to use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> methods instead of <code>withFixture</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.featurespec.composingbeforeandaftereach
 * 
 * import org.scalatest._

 * trait Builder extends BeforeAndAfterEach { this: Suite =&gt;
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 *

 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * To get the same ordering as <code>withFixture</code>, place your <code>super.beforeEach</code> call at the end of each
 * <code>beforeEach</code> method, and the <code>super.afterEach</code> call at the beginning of each <code>afterEach</code>
 * method, as shown in the previous example. It is a good idea to invoke <code>super.afterEach</code> in a <code>try</code>
 * block and perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause, as shown in the previous example, because this ensures the
 * cleanup code is performed even if <code>super.afterEach</code> throws an exception.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The difference between stacking traits that extend <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> versus traits that implement <code>withFixture</code> is
 * that setup and cleanup code happens before and after the test in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>, but at the beginning and
 * end of the test in <code>withFixture</code>. Thus if a <code>withFixture</code> method completes abruptly with an exception, it is
 * considered a failed test. By contrast, if any of the <code>beforeEach</code> or <code>afterEach</code> methods of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> 
 * complete abruptly, it is considered an aborted suite, which will result in a <a href="events/SuiteAborted.html"><code>SuiteAborted</code></a> event.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <a name="sharedScenarios"></a><h2>Shared scenarios</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are "shared"
 * by different fixture objects.
 * To accomplish this in a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, you first place shared tests (<em>i.e.</em>, shared scenarios) in
 * <em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
 * invoked during the construction phase of any <code>FeatureSpec</code> that uses them, so that the scenarios they contain will
 * be registered as scenarios in that <code>FeatureSpec</code>.
 * For example, given this stack class:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class Stack[T] {
 *
 *   val MAX = 10
 *   private val buf = new ListBuffer[T]
 *
 *   def push(o: T) {
 *     if (!full)
 *       buf.prepend(o)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't push onto a full stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def pop(): T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf.remove(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def peek: T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def full: Boolean = buf.size == MAX
 *   def empty: Boolean = buf.size == 0
 *   def size = buf.size
 *
 *   override def toString = buf.mkString("Stack(", ", ", ")")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
 * <em>etc</em>. You may find you have several scenarios that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
 * those same scenarios for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
 * capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these scenarios out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
 * stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>FeatureSpec</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
 * behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared scenarios are run for all three fixtures.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared scenarios inside the <code>FeatureSpec</code> that uses them. If they are shared
 * between different <code>FeatureSpec</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into
 * each <code>FeatureSpec</code> that uses them.
 * <a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a
 * behavior <em>method</em>) is defined in a trait along with another
 * method containing shared scenarios for non-full stacks:

 * If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and
 * reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
 * in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be

 * extra work to ensure that the test names are unique. If a duplicate test name problem shows up in a
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code>, you can pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can pass this string
 * the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests, or just call <code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object.
 * This is the approach taken by the previous <code>FeatureSpecStackBehaviors</code> example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given this <code>FeatureSpecStackBehaviors</code> trait, calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItem</code> fixture, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * scenariosFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * yields test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>empty is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9)</code></li>
 * <li><code>peek is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9)</code></li>
 * <li><code>pop is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9)</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Whereas calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity</code> fixture, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * scenariosFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * yields different test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>empty is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)</code></li>
 * <li><code>peek is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)</code></li>
 * <li><code>pop is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)</code></li>
 * </ul>
