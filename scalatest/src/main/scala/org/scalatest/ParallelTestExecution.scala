/**
 * Trait that causes that the tests of any suite it is mixed into to be run in parallel if
 * a <code>Distributor</code> is passed to <code>runTests</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * ScalaTest's normal approach for running suites of tests in parallel is to run different suites in parallel,
 * but the tests of any one suite sequentially. This approach should provide sufficient distribution of the work load
 * in most cases, but some suites may encapsulate multiple long-running tests. Such suites may dominate the execution
 * time of the run. If so, mixing in this trait into just those suites will allow their long-running tests to run in parallel with each
 * other, thereby helping to reduce the total time required to run an entire run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To make it easier for users to write tests that run in parallel, this trait runs each test in its own instance of the class.
 * Running each test in its own instance enables tests to use the same instance <code>vars</code> and mutable objects referenced from
 * instance variables without needing to synchronize. Although ScalaTest provides functional approaches to
 * factoring out common test code that can help avoid such issues, running each test in its own instance is an insurance policy that makes 
 * running tests in parallel easier and less error prone.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the details on how <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> works, see the documentation for methods <code>run</code>, <code>runTests</code>, and <code>runTest</code>,
 * which this trait overrides.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: This trait's implementation of <code>runTest</code> is <code>final</code>, to ensure that behavior
 * related to individual tests are executed by the same thread that executes the actual test. This means,
 * for example, that you won't be allowed to write <code>...with ParallelTestExecution with BeforeAndAfter</code>.
 * Instead, you'd need to put <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> last, as
 * in: <code>with BeforeAndAfter with ParallelTestExecution</code>. For more details, see the documentation
 * for the <code>runTest</code> method.

   * distributing this test by invoking <code>distributingTest</code> on it, passing in the

   *
   * <p>

   * traits like <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> can only be "super" to <code>ParallelTestExecution</code>
   * and, therefore, that its <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> code will be run
   * by the same distributed thread that runs the test itself.
