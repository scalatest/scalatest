/**
 * The result status of running a test or a suite, which is used to support parallel and asynchronous execution of tests.
 *
 * <p>
 * This trait is the result type of the "run" lifecycle methods of trait <a href="Suite.html#lifecycle-methods"><code>Suite</code></a>:
 * <code>run</code>, <code>runNestedSuites</code>, <code>runTests</code>, and <code>runTest</code>. It can be used to determine whether
 * a test or suite has completed, and if so, whether it succeeded, and if not, whether an exception was thrown that was
 * not yet reported via a ScalaTest event. A <code>Status</code> is like a domain-specific <code>Future[Boolean]</code>, where:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>an activity in which no test failed and no suite aborted is represented by <code>Success(true)</code></li>
 * <li>an activity during which at least one test failed or one suite aborted, but all exceptions that occured
 *     were reported by a ScalaTest events (such as <a href="exceptions/TestFailedException.html"><code>TestFailedException</code></a>)
 *     is represented by <code>Success(false)</code></li>
 * <li>an activity during which at least one test failed or one suite aborted and at least one exception occurred that was
 *     <em>not</em> reported via a ScalaTest event is represented by <code>Failure(unreportedException)</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that pending and canceled tests will not cause a <code>Status</code> to fail. Only failed tests
 * and aborted suites will cause a <code>Status</code> to fail.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One use case of <code>Status</code> is to ensure that "after" code (such as an <code>afterEach</code> or <code>afterAll</code> method)
 * does not execute until after the relevant entity (one test, one suite, or all of a suite's tests or nested suites) has completed.
 * Another use case is to implement the default behavior of asynchronous styles, in which subsequent each test does not begin
 * execution until after the previous test has completed.

   *
   * <p>
   * When a test executes, "non-run-aborting" thrown exceptions are reported by events
   * fired to the reporter. A <a href="exceptions/TestPendingException.html"><code>TestPendingException</code></a> is reported via a
   * <a href="events/TestPending.html"><code>TestPending</code></a> event. A <a href="exceptions/TestCanceledException.html"><code>TestCanceledException</code></a> is reported via a

   * <a href="exceptions/TestFailedException.html"><code>TestFailedException</code></a> will be reported via a
   * <a href="events/TestFailed.html"><code>TestFailed</code></a> event.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Run-aborting exceptions indicate critical
   * problems, such as <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>, that instead of being reported via a test completion event
   * should instead cause the entire suite to abort. In synchronous testing styles, this exception will be allowed
   * to just propagate up the call stack. But in async styles, the thread or threads executing the test will often
   * be taken from the async suite's execution context. Instead of propagating these run-aborting exceptions up
   * the call stack, they will be installed as an "unreported exception" in the test's <code>Status</code>.
   * They are "unreported" because no test completion event will be fired to report them. For more explanation and
   * a list of run-aborting exception types, see <a href="Suite.html#errorHandling">Treatment of <code>java.lang.Error</code>s</a>.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Another way for an unreported exception to occur is if an exception of any type is thrown outside of the
   * body of an actual test. For example, traits <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>,  <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>,
   * and <code>BeforeAndAfterEachTestData</code> execute code before and after tests. Traits
   * <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> and </p><code>BeforeAndAfterAllConfigMap</code> execute code before
   * and after all tests and nested suites of a suite. If any "before" or "after"
   * code completes abruptly with an exception (of any type, not just run-aborting types) on a thread taken
   * from an async suite's execution context, this exception will
   * installed as an <code>unreportedException</code> of the relevant <code>Status</code>.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * In addition, ScalaTest <code>Suite</code> exposes four "run" lifecycle methods--<code>run</code>,
   * <code>runNestedSuites</code>, <code>runTests</code>, and <code>runTest</code>--that users can override to customize
   * the framework. If a "run" lifecycle methods completes abruptly with an exception, that exception occurs outside
   * the context of a test body. As a result, such exceptions will be
   * installed as an <code>unreportedException</code> of the relevant <code>Status</code>.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * The <code>toFuture</code> method on <code>Status</code> returns a <code>Future[Boolean]</code>. If the <code>Future</code>
   * succeeds with the <code>Boolean</code> value of <code>true</code>, that indicates no tests failed and no suites aborted
   * during the activity represented
   * by this <code>Status</code>. If a test failed or suite aborted, and that event was reported by a fired ScalaTest
   * <a href="events.Event.html"><code>Event</code></a>, the
   * <code>Future</code> will succeed with the value <code>false</code>. If an unreported exception has been installed
   * on the <code>Status</code>, however, the <code>Future</code> will fail with that exception.
