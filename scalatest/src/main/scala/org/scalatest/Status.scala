 * This trait is the return type of the "run" lifecycle methods of trait <a href="Suite.html#lifecycle-methods"><code>Suite</code></a>: <code>run</code>, <code>runNestedSuites</code>,

 * method to wait until all relevant tests and nested suites have completed before performing the "after all" code, even if those tests are
 * nested suites are run in parallel.
