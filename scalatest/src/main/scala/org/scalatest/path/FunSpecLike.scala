/**
 * Implementation trait for class <code>path.FunSpec</code>, which is
 * a sister class to <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code> that isolates
 * tests by running each test in its own instance of the test class,
 * and for each test, only executing the <em>path</em> leading to that test.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <a href="FunSpec.html"><code>path.FunSpec</code></a> is a class, not a trait,
 * to minimize compile time given there is a slight compiler overhead to
 * mixing in traits compared to extending classes. If you need to mix the
 * behavior of <code>path.FunSpec</code> into some other class, you can use this
 * trait instead, because class <code>path.FunSpec</code> does nothing more than
 * extend this trait and add a nice <code>toString</code> implementation.
 * </p>

 * See the documentation of the class for a <a href="FunSpec.html">detailed
 * overview of <code>path.FunSpec</code></a>.
