     runNow will keep executing jobs passed to execute until the
     Future passed to runNow completes. If it runs out of jobs to
     do before the Future completes, it enters the wait set.
     Adding another job to the queue will notify it. We don't
     notify when the future completes, because the last thing an
     AsyncSuite currently does is that it transforms a completed
     Future[Assertion] returned from the test into a Future[Outcome].
     That transformation is done using the executionContext, which
     in this case is a SerialExecutionContext. This is always the
     final transformation needed to complete a test, after which
     the Future[Outcome] will be complete. It therefore is enqueued
     onto the LinkedBlockingQueue by calling execute. If from a
     thread other than the main test thread, this will do a notifyAll
     to wake up the main test thread if it is sitting in the wait
     loop in runNow:

     // After being notified, wait() will return
     synchronized { wait() }

     If so, it will loop back and find that as yet the Future[Outcome]
     is not completed, so it will execute the while body again:
  
      while (!future.isCompleted) {
        // It will execute here again
      }
 
     It will find out that the queue does actually contain a job to do:

     // queue.peek will return a job to do, not null
     while (queue.peek != null)

     It will execute this job, which is the transformation from
     Future[Assertion] to Future[Outcome]:

     // This will transform Future[Assertion] => Future[Outcome]
     queue.poll().run()

     That will complete the Future[Outcome], so when it tests to
     see if the Future[Outcome] is completed, it will find that it
     has:

     // This if test fails. !future.isCompleted is now false
     if (!future.isCompleted)

     Thus it will skip the wait() call and loop back to the top
     of the outer while. That will finally return false:
    
      while (!future.isCompleted) {
        // Doesn't get here
      } // Just hops down here because the future is now complete
 
      And runNow will return, as this test has finished running.
