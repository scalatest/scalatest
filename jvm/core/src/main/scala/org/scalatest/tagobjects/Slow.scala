 * Tag object that indicates a test is slow (<em>i.e.</em>, takes a long time to run).

 * The corresponding tag annotation for this tag object is <code>org.scalatest.tags.Slow</code>.
 * This tag object can be used to tag test functions (in style traits other than <code>Spec</code>, in which tests are methods not functions) as being slow.
 * See the "tagging tests" section in the documentation for your chosen styles to see the syntax. Here's an example for <code>FlatSpec</code>:
