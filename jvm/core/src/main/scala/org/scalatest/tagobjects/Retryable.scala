/**
 * Tag object that indicates a test is a candidate for retrying on either failure, cancellation, or both.
 *
 * <p>
 * This tag object is intended to be used in conjunction with trait <a href="../Retries.html"><code>Retries</code></a>, to
 * identify tests that are candidates for retrying.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The corresponding tag annotation for this tag object is <code>org.scalatest.tags.Retryable</code>.
 * This tag object can be used to tag test functions (in style traits other than <code>Spec</code>, in which tests are methods
 * not functions) as being a candidate for retries.  See the "tagging tests" section in the documentation for your chosen styles to
 * see the syntax. Here's an example for <code>FlatSpec</code>:

 * <pre class="stHighlight">

 * import tagobjects.Retryable

 * class SetSpec extends FlatSpec with Retries {
 * 
 *   override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) = {
 *     if (isRetryable(test))
 *       withRetry { super.withFixture(test) }
 *     else
