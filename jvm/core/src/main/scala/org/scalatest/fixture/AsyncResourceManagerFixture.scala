/**
 * A trait that facilitates automatic management and cleanup of resources 
 * in asynchronous tests using `org.scalactic.Using.Manager`.
 *
 * A **Test-scoped manager** is
 *    - Passed as a fixture parameter to each test (`FixtureParam`).  
 *    - Automatically created before and disposed after each test.  
 *    - Intended for resources needed only within a single test.
 *    - If you need to manage resources shared across tests,
 *      check out `ResourceManager` in the `org.scalatest` package
 *
 * Example usage:
 * {{{
 * class MyAsyncSuite extends AsyncFunSuite with AsyncResourceManagerFixture {
 *
 *   test("something async") { use =>
 *     val connection = use(getClass().getResourceAsStream("some-resource"))
 *     Future {
 *       // Use stream in the test
 *       // Stream will be closed after the test
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * @note This trait extends `FixtureAsyncTestSuite` and sets `FixtureParam` to `Using.Manager`.
 * @see [[org.scalactic.Using.Manager]] for details on how resource management is handled safely.
