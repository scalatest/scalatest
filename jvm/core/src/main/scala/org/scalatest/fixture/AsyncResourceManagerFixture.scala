/**
 * A trait that facilitates automatic management and cleanup of resources 
 * in asynchronous tests using `org.scalactic.Using.Manager`.
 *
 * This trait provides two `Using.Manager` instances to support different scopes:
 *
 * 1. **Suite-scoped manager**:  
 *    - Accessible via the `suiteScoped` method.  
 *    - Intended for managing resources shared across multiple tests in the suite.  
 *    - This manager is only available during test execution; calling `suiteScoped`
 *      outside of a test (e.g., during suite construction) will throw an `IllegalStateException`.
 *    - To use this safely, define a `lazy val` in your suite that calls `suiteScoped`
 *      when first accessed, ensuring it is evaluated during test execution.
 *
 * 2. **Test-scoped manager**:  
 *    - Passed as a fixture parameter to each test (`FixtureParam`).  
 *    - Automatically created before and disposed after each test.  
 *    - Intended for resources needed only within a single test.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * {{{
 * class MyAsyncSuite extends AsyncResourceManagerFixture {
 *   lazy val sharedClient = suiteScoped(new ExpensiveClient)
 *
 *   test("something async") { use =>
 *     val connection = use(sharedClient.getConnection())
 *     Future {
 *       // Use connection asynchronously
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * @note This trait extends `FixtureAsyncTestSuite` and sets `FixtureParam` to `Using.Manager`.
 * @see [[org.scalactic.Using.Manager]] for details on how resource management is handled safely.
