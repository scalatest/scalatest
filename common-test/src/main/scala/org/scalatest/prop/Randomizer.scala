/**
  * Provide random values, of many different types.
  *
  * This is loosely inspired by [[java.util.Random]] (and is designed to produce the same values in
  * conventional cases), with two major differences:
  *
  *  - It provides random values for many more types;
  *  - In proper Scala fashion, this class is immutable.
  *
  * On the first of those points, this returns many data types, including many of the tightly-defined
  * numeric types from Scalactic. These allow you to put tight constraints on precisely what numbers
  * you want to have available -- positive, negative, zeroes, infinities and so on. We strongly recommend
  * that you use the function that most exactly describes the values you are looking for.
  *
  * That second point is the more important one. You shouldn't call the same [[Randomizer]] over and
  * over, the way you would do in Java. Instead, each call to a [[Randomizer]] function returns the
  * ''next'' [[Randomizer]], which you should use for the next call.
  *
  * '''If you are using random floating-point values:''' the algorithms in use here
  * produce random values across the potential space of values. But due to the way
  * floating-point works, this means that these values are strongly biased towards
  * ''small'' numbers. There are many floating-point numbers with negative exponents,
  * so you may get more numbers in the range between -1 and 1 than you expect.
