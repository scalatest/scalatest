Building ScalaTest
------------------

### Pre-Requisites

The followings are needed for building ScalaTest:

*   JDK 6, 7 or 8
*   [SBT 0.13.1](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.1/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html)

for JDK 6 or 7, use the following options in your SBT launch file:

    SBT_OPTS="-server -Xms512M -Xmx3000M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:NewRatio=8 -XX:MaxPermSize=512M"

for JDK 8, use the following SBT options instead:

    SBT_OPTS="-server -Xms512M -Xmx3000M -Xss1M  -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:NewRatio=8"

### Building and Running Tests

This command will build and run the regular tests:

  `$ sbt test`

To run generated tests, you'll need to increase maximum heap size to -Xmx5000M, and use this command instead:

  `$ sbt gentests/test`

What it does is simply switch to gentests project and run test.

### Packaging

You can package the ScalaTest JAR file using this command:

  `$ sbt package`

The resulting JAR file will be produced in target/scala-2.10/.

You can also publish it to your local Ivy repository using this command:

  `$ sbt publishLocal`

Or publish it to local maven repository using this command:

  `$ sbt publishM2`

### Publishing

To publish to Sonatype, you first need to make sure you have the following:

*   A GPG client is installed on your command line path. For more information, please refer to [GNU Privacy Guard Website](http://www.gnupg.org/).
*   You have created your GPG keys and distributed your public key to hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net/. For more information, please refer to [How To Generate PGP Signatures With Maven](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven).
*   You have been granted the right to publish using org.scalatest and org.scalautils domain.

By default, ScalaTest build will read your Sonatype credentials from ~/.ivy2/.credentials, which is a properties file that looks like this:

    realm=Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager
    host=oss.sonatype.org
    user=xxxxxxxx
    password=xxxxxxxx

You can use SCALATEST_NEXUS_LOGIN and SCALATEST_NEXUS_PASSWORD environment variables to override Sonatype credentials.

For signing, ScalaTest build will use ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg by default and prompt for GPG passphase if required.  Alternatively you can use SCALATEST_GPG_FILE to use a different GPG file, and use SCALATEST_GPG_PASSPHASE to provide GPG passphase to avoid input prompt.

If you would like to export a particular private key into a separate GPG file, you can use the following command:

  `$ gpg --export-secret-keys example@example.com > example-secret-key.gpg`

With Sonatype credentials and GPG file in place, you can now publish to Sonatype.

To publish ScalaTest, use the following command:

  `$ sbt publishSigned`

To publish ScalaUtils, use the following command:

  `$ sbt scalautils/publishSigned`
