This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to invoke the "describe" or "it" methods on the object before the first thread completed its construction.
concurrentFreeSpecMod=Two threads attempted to modify FreeSpec's internal data, which should only be modified by the thread that constructs the object.

concurrentFixtureSpecMod=Two threads attempted to modify FixtureSpec's internal data, which should only be modified by the thread that constructs the object. This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to invoke the "describe" or "it" methods on the object before the first thread completed its construction.
concurrentFlatSpecMod=Two threads attempted to modify FlatSpec's internal data, which should only be modified by the thread that constructs the object. This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to register tests (such as with "it should") on the object before the first thread completed its construction.

concurrentWordSpecMod=Two threads attempted to modify WordSpec's internal data, which should only be modified by the thread that constructs the object. This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to register tests (such as with "do something" in) on the object before the first thread completed its construction.

concurrentFeatureSpecMod=Two threads attempted to modify FeatureSpec's internal data, which should only be modified by the thread that constructs the object. This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to invoke the "feature" or "scenario" methods on the object before the first thread completed its construction.

This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to invoke the "feature" or "scenario" methods on the object before the first thread completed its construction.
concurrentDocSpecMod=Two threads attempted to modify Doc's internal data, which should only be modified by the thread that constructs the object. This likely means that a subclass has allowed the this reference to escape during construction, and some other thread attempted to invoke the "body" method on the object before the first thread completed its construction.
