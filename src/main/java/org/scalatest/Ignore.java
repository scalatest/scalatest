package org.scalatest;

import java.lang.annotation.*; 

/**
 * Annotation used to tag a test, or suite of tests, as ignored.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Note: This is actually an annotation defined in Java, not a Scala trait. It must be defined in Java instead of Scala so it will be accessible
 * at runtime. It has been inserted into Scaladoc by pretending it is a trait.</em>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you wish to temporarily ignore an entire suite of tests, you can annotate the test class with <code>@Ignore</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.flatspec.ignoreall
 * 
 * import org.scalatest._
 * 
 * @Ignore
 * class SetSpec extends FlatSpec {
 * 
 *   "An empty Set" should "have size 0" in {
 *     assert(Set.empty.size === 0)
 *   }
 * 
 *   it should "produce NoSuchElementException when head is invoked" in {
 *     intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *       Set.empty.head
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When you mark a test class with a tag annotation, ScalaTest will mark each test defined in that class with that tag.
 * Thus, marking the <code>SetSpec</code> in the above example with the <code>@Ignore</code> tag annotation means that both tests
 * in the class will be ignored. If you run the above <code>SetSpec</code> in the Scala interpreter, you'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; new SetSpec execute
 * <span class="stGreen">An empty Set</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- should have size 0 !!! IGNORED !!!
 * - should produce NoSuchElementException when head is invoked !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that marking a test class as ignored won't prevent it from being discovered by ScalaTest. Ignored classes
 * will be discovered and run, and all their tests will be reported as ignored. This is intended to keep the ignored
 * class somewhat visible, to encourage the developers to eventually fix and un-ignore it. If you want to
 * prevent a class from being discovered at all, use the <a href="DoNotDiscover.html"><code>DoNotDiscover</code></a> annotation instead.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another use case for <code>@Ignore</code> is to mark test <em>methods</em> as ignored in traits <a href="Spec.html"><code>Spec</code></a>
 * and <a href="fixture/Spec.html"><code>fixture.Spec</code></a>. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.spec.ignore
 *
 * import org.scalatest._
 *
 * class SetSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   @Ignore def &#96;an empty Set should have size 0&#96; {
 *     assert(Set.empty.size === 0)
 *   }
 *
 *   def &#96;invoking head on an empty Set should produce NoSuchElementException&#96; {
 *     intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *       Set.empty.head
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>SetSpec</code> in the Scala interpreter, you'll see that it
 * runs only the second test and reports that the first test was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; new SetSpec execute
 * <span class="stGreen">SetSpec:
 * <span class="stYellow">- an empty Set should have size 0 !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
 * <span class="stGreen">- invoking head on an empty Set should produce NoSuchElementException</span>
 * </pre>
