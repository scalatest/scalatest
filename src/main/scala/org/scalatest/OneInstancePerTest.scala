/**
 * Trait that facilitates a style of testing in which each test is run in its own instance
 * of the suite class to isolate each test from the side effects of the other tests in the
 * suite.
 *
 * <table><tr><td class="usage">
 * <strong>Recommended Usage</strong>: Trait <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> is intended primarily to serve as a supertrait for
 * <a href="ParallelTestExecution.html"><code>ParallelTestExecution</code></a> and the <a href="path/package.html">path traits</a>, to
 * facilitate porting JUnit tests to ScalaTest, and to make it easy for users who prefer JUnit's approach to isolation to obtain similar
 * behavior in ScalaTest.
 * </td></tr></table>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you mix this trait into a <a href="Suite.html"><code>Suite</code></a>, you can initialize shared reassignable
 * fixture variables as well as shared mutable fixture objects in the constructor of the
 * class. Because each test will run in its own instance of the class, each test will
 * get a fresh copy of the instance variables. This is the approach to test isolation taken,
 * for example, by the JUnit framework. <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> can, therefore,
 * be handy when porting JUnit tests to ScalaTest.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's an example of <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> being used in a <code>FunSuite</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * import org.scalatest.OneInstancePerTest
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class MySuite extends FunSuite with OneInstancePerTest {
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   test("easy") {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   test("fun") {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> is supertrait to <a href="ParallelTestExecution.html"><code>ParallelTestExecution</code></a>, in which
 * running each test in its own instance is intended to make it easier to write suites of tests that run in parallel (by reducing the likelihood
 * of concurrency bugs in those suites.) <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> is also supertrait to the <em>path</em> traits,
 * <a href="path/FunSpec.html"><code>path.FunSpec</code></a> and <a href="path/FreeSpec.html"><code>path.FreeSpec</code></a>, to make it obvious
 * these traits run each test in a new, isolated instance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For the details on how <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> works, see the documentation for methods <code>runTests</code> and <code>runTest</code>,
 * which this trait overrides.
