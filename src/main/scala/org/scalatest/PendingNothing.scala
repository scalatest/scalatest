/**
 * Type that is used as the return type of the <code>pending</code> method in class
 * <code>Suite</code>, which always completes abruptly with a
 * <code>TestPendingException</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * This type is used primarily to facilitate the <code>is (pending)</code> syntax of
 * traits <code>FlatSpec</code> and <code>WordSpec</code>, as well the
 * <code>is (pending)</code> or <code>(pending)</code> syntax of several traits
 * in the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code>package. Because the <code>pending</code>
 * method in <code>Suite</code> always completes abruptly with an exception, its
 * type would be inferred to be <code>Nothing</code>, which is a relatively common
 * type. To make sure syntax like <code>is (pending)</code> only works with
 * method <code>pending</code>, it is helpful to have a specially named
 * "<code>Nothing</code>" type.
