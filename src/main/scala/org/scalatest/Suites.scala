/**
 * A <code>Suite</code> class that takes zero to many <code>Suite</code>s in its constructor,
 *  which will be returned from its <code>nestedSuites</code> method.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, you can define a suite that always executes a list of
 * nested suites like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class StepsSuite extends Suites(
 *   new Step1Suite,
 *   new Step2Suite,
 *   new Step3Suite,
 *   new Step4Suite,
 *   new Step5Suite
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If <code>StepsSuite</code> is executed sequentially, it will execute its
 * nested suites in the passed order: <code>Step1Suite</code>, <code>Step2Suite</code>,
 * <code>Step3Suite</code>, <code>Step4Suite</code>, and <code>Step5Suite</code>.
 * If <code>StepsSuite</code> is executed in parallel, the nested suites will
 * be executed concurrently.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param suitesToNest a sequence of <code>Suite</code>s to nest.
 *
 * @throws NullPointerException if <code>suitesToNest</code>, or any suite
 * it contains, is <code>null</code>.
