 * <code>UpdateProvided</code> differs from <a href="InfoProvided.html"><code>InfoProvided</code></a> in that unlike <code>InfoProvided</code>, <code>UpdateProvided</code> isn't
 * a <a href="RecordableEvent.html"><code>RecordableEvent</code></a>. If fired becase of an <code>update</code> call from a test, for example, the <code>UpdateProvided</code> will immediately
 * be sent to the reporters rather than being stored and sent in the <code>recordedEvents</code> field of the test completion event. Thus,
 * <code>UpdateProvided</code> enables "status updates" to be provided
 * while tests are happening. The difference between <code>UpdateProvided</code> and <a href="AlertProvided.html"><code>AlertProvided</code></a>, which is also a "status update"
 * fired immediately during tests, is that <code>AlertProvided</code> is intended for warnings, where as <code>UpdateProvided</code> is just
