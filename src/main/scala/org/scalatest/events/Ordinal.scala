/**
 * Class used to specify a sequential order for events reported during a test run, so they
 * can be arranged in that order in a report even if the events were fired in some other order
 * during concurrent or distributed execution.
 *
 * <p>
 * An <code>Ordinal</code> is an immutable object holding a <em>run stamp</em> and a sequence
 * of <em>stamps</em>.
 * The run stamp is an integer that identifies a particular run. All events
 * reported during the same run should share the same run stamp. By contrast, each
 * event reported during a particular run should have a different stamp sequence.
 * One use case for the run stamp is that the initial run from ScalaTest's GUI
 * will have run stamp 0. Subsequent reruns will have run stamps 1,
 * 2, 3, <em>etc.</em>, so that reports in the GUI can simply be sorted in "ordinal" order. Another
 * use case is a set of servers used to run multiple tests simultaneously in a distributed
 * fashion. The run stamp can be used to identify the run to which an event belongs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The stamp sequence is designed to allow a sequential order of events to be specified during
 * concurrent execution of ScalaTest suites. ScalaTest's model for concurrent execution is that
 * the suites that make up a run may be executed concurrently, but the tests within a single suite
 * will be executed sequentially. In addition to tests, suites may contain nested suites. The default implementation
 * of <code>execute</code> in class <a href="../Suite.html"><code>Suite</code></a> will first invoke <code>runNestedSuites</code> and
 * then <code>runTests</code>. If no <a href="../Distributor.html"><code>Distributor</code></a> is passed to <code>execute</code>, the
 * <code>runNestedSuites</code> method will execute the nested suites sequentially via the same thread
 * that invoked <code>runNestedSuites</code>. As a result, suites will by default executed in depth first order
 * when executed sequentially. If a <code>Distributor</code> is passed to <code>execute</code>, the
 * <code>runNestedSuites</code> method will simply put its nested suites into the <code>Distributor</code>
 * and return. Some other threads or processes must then execute those nested suites. Given the default
 * implementations of <code>execute</code> and <code>runNestedSuites</code> described here, the <code>Ordinal</code>
 * will allow the events from a concurrent run to be sorted in the same depth-first order that the events
 * from a corresponding sequential run would arrive.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each event reported during a run should be given a unique <code>Ordinal</code>. An <code>Ordinal</code> is required
 * by all <a href="Event.html"><code>Event</code></a> subclasses, instances of which are used to send information to the <code>report</code>
 * function passed to a <code>Suite</code>'s <code>execute</code> method. The first <code>Ordinal</code> for a run
 * can be produced by passing a run stamp to <code>Ordinal</code>'s lone public constructor:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * val firstOrdinal = new Ordinal(99)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The run stamp can be any integer. The <code>Ordinal</code> created in this way can be passed along with the first
 * reported event of the run, such as a <a href="RunStarting.html"><code>RunStarting</code></a> event. Thereafter, new <code>Ordinal</code>s for the same run
 * can be obtained by calling either <code>next</code> or <code>nextNewOldPair</code> on the previously obtained <code>Ordinal</code>.
 * In other words, given an <code>Ordinal</code>, you can obtain the next <code>Ordinal</code> by invoking one of these two
 * "next" methods on the <code>Ordinal</code> you have in hand. Before executing a new <code>Suite</code>, the <code>nextNewOldPair</code>
 * method should be invoked. This will return two new <code>Ordinal</code>s, one for the new <code>Suite</code> about to be executed, and
 * one for the currently executing entity (either a <code>Suite</code> or some sort of test runner). At any other time, the next <code>Ordinal</code>
 * can be obtained by simply invoking <code>next</code> on the current <code>Ordinal</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can convert an <code>Ordinal</code> to a <code>List</code> by invoking <code>toList</code> on it. The resulting <code>List</code> will contain
 * the run stamp as its first element, and the contents of its stamps sequence as the subsequent elements. The stamps
 * sequence will initially be composed of a single element with the value 0. Thus, <code>toList</code> invoked on the <code>firstOrdinal</code> shown above will 
 * result in:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * firstOrdinal.toList // results in: List(99, 0)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each time <code>next</code> is invoked, the rightmost integer returned by <code>toList</code> will increment: 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * val secondOrdinal = firstOrdinal.next
 * secondOrdinal.toList // results in: List(99, 1)
 * 
 * val thirdOrdinal = secondOrdinal.next
 * thirdOrdinal.toList  // result is : List(99, 2)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When <code>nextNewOldPair</code> is invoked the result will be a tuple whose first element is the first <code>Ordinal</code> for
 * the new <code>Suite</code> about to be executed (for example, a nested <code>Suite</code> of the currently executing <code>Suite</code>). The
 * second element is the next <code>Ordinal</code> for the currently executing <code>Suite</code> or other entity:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * val (nextForNewSuite, nextForThisRunner) = thirdOrdinal.nextNewOldPair
 * nextForNewSuite.toList   // results in: (99, 2, 0)
 * nextForThisRunner.toList // results in: (99, 3)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>toList</code> method of the <code>Ordinal</code> for the new suite starts with the same sequence of elements as the <code>Ordinal</code> from which it was
 * created, but has one more element, a 0, appended at the end. Subsequent invocations of <code>next</code> on this series of <code>Ordinal</code>s will
 * increment that last element:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * val newSuiteOrdinal2 = nextForNewSuite.next
 * newSuiteOrdinal2.toList // results in: List(99, 2, 1)
 * 
 * val newSuiteOrdinal3 = newSuiteOrdinal2.next
 * newSuiteOrdinal3.toList  // result is : List(99, 2, 2)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This behavior allows events fired by <code>Suite</code> running concurrently to be reordered in a pre-determined sequence after all the events
 * have been reported. The ordering of two <code>Ordinal</code>s can be determined by first comparing the first element of the <code>List</code>s obtained
 * by invoking <code>toList</code> on both <code>Ordinal</code>s. These values represent the <code>runStamp</code>. If one run stamp is a lower number than
 * the other, that <code>Ordinal</code> comes first. For example, an <code>Ordinal</code> with a run stamp of 98 is ordered before an <code>Ordinal</code> with
 * a run stamp of 99. If the run stamps are equal, the next number in the list is inspected. As with the run stamps, an  <code>Ordinal</code> with a lower
 * number is ordered before an <code>Ordinal</code> with a higher number. If two corresponding elements are equal, the next pair of elements will be inspected.
 * This will continue no down the length of the <code>List</code>s until a position is found where the element values are not equal, or the end of one or both of
 * the <code>List</code>s are reached. If the two <code>List</code>s are identical all the way to the end, and both <code>List</code>s have the same lengths, 
 * then the <code>Ordinal</code>s are equal. (Equal <code>Ordinal</code>s will not happen if correctly used by creating a new <code>Ordinal</code> for
 * each fired event and each new <code>Suite</code>.). If the two <code>List</code>s are identical all the way to the end of one, but the other <code>List</code>
 * is longer (has more elements), then the shorter list is ordered before the longer one.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As an example, here are some <code>Ordinal</code> <code>List</code> forms in order:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * List(99, 0)
 * List(99, 1)
 * List(99, 2)
 * List(99, 2, 0)
 * List(99, 2, 1)
 * List(99, 2, 2)
 * List(99, 2, 2, 0)
 * List(99, 2, 2, 1)
 * List(99, 2, 2, 2)
 * List(99, 2, 3)
 * List(99, 2, 4)
 * List(99, 2, 4, 0)
 * List(99, 2, 4, 1)
 * List(99, 2, 4, 2)
 * List(99, 3)
 * List(99, 4)
 * List(99, 4, 0)
 * List(99, 4, 1)
 * List(99, 5)
 * </pre>
