/**
 * Trait implemented by exception types that carry an optional payload.
 *
 * <p>
 * Many ScalaTest events include an optional "payload" field that can be used
 * to pass information to a custom reporter. This trait facilitates such customization, 
 * by allowing test code to include a payload in an exception (such as <code>TestFailedException</code>).
 * ScalaTest looks for this trait and fires any payloads it finds in the relevant ScalaTest event
 * stimulated by the exception, such as a <code>TestFailed</code> event stimulated by a <code>TestFailedException</code>.
 * (Although in its initial
 * release there is only two subclasses of <code>PayloadField</code> in ScalaTest,
 * <a href="TestFailedException.html"><code>TestFailedException</code></a> and
 * <a href="TestCanceledException.html"><code>TestCanceledException</code></a>,
 * in future version of ScalaTest, there could be more)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For an example of how payloads could be used, see the documentation for trait <a href="../Payloads.html"><code>Payloads</code></a>.
 * </p>
