/**
 * Trait implemented by <code>PayloadField</code> exception types that can modify their payload.
 *
 * <p>
 * This trait facilitates the <code>withPayload</code> construct provided by trait
 * <code>Payloads</code>. This construct enables a payload object (or modified
 * payload object) to be included as the payload of a thrown exception. The payload
 * can then be included in the ScalaTest event that results from that exception. For
 * example, the payload included in a <code>TestFailedException</code> will be included
 * as the payload of the resulting <code>TestFailed</code> event. Here's an example in
 * which a GUI snapshot is included as a payload when a test fails:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * withPayload(generateGUISnapshot()) {
 *   1 + 1 should be === 3
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Exception types that mix in this trait have a <code>modifyPayload</code> method, which
 * returns an exception identical to itself, except with the payload option replaced with
 * the result of invoking the passed function, supplying the current payload option
 * as the lone <code>Option[Any]</code> parameter.
 * </p>

   * as the lone <code>Option[Any]</code> parameter.
   *
   * <p>
   * Implementations of this method may either mutate this exception or return
   * a new instance with the revised detail message.
   * </p>
