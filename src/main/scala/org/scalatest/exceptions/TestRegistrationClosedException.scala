/**
 * Exception that indicates an action that is only allowed during a suite's test registration phase,
 * such as registering a test to run or ignore, was attempted after registration had already closed.
 *
 * <p>
 * In suites that register tests as functions, such as <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>FunSpec</code>, tests
 * are normally registered during construction. Although it is not the usual approach, tests can also
 * be registered after construction by invoking methods that register tests on the already constructed suite so
 * long as <code>run</code> has not been invoked on that suite.
 * As soon as <code>run</code> is invoked for the first time, registration of tests is "closed," meaning
 * that any further attempts to register a test will fail (and result in an instance of this exception class being thrown). This
 * can happen, for example, if an attempt is made to nest tests, such as in a <code>FunSuite</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * test("this test is fine") {
 *   test("but this nested test is not allowed") {
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This exception encapsulates information about the stack depth at which the line of code that made this attempt resides,
 * so that information can be presented to the user that makes it quick to find the problem line of code. (In other words,
 * the user need not scan through the stack trace to find the correct filename and line number of the offending code.)
 * </p>
 *
 * @param message the exception's detail message
 * @param failedCodeStackDepth the depth in the stack trace of this exception at which the line of code that attempted
 *   to register the test after registration had been closed.
 *
 * @throws NullPointerException if either <code>message</code> or <code>failedCodeStackDepthFun</code> is <code>null</code>
