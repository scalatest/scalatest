/**
 * Trait that encapsulates the information required of an exception thrown by ScalaTest's assertions
 * and matchers, which includes a stack depth at which the failing line of test code resides.
 *
 * <p>
 * This trait exists so that it can be mixed into two exception superclasses, <a href="StackDepthException.html"><code>StackDepthException</code></a>,
 * from which extend several exceptions that do not depend on JUnit, and <a href="../junit/JUnitTestFailedError.html"><code>JUnitTestFailedError</code></a>, which
 * does depend on JUnit. The latter, which requires JUnit be in the classpath, ensures failed ScalaTest assertions are
 * reported as "failures," not "errors," by JUnit.
