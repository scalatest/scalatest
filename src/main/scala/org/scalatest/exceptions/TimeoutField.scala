/**
 * Trait mixed into exceptions thrown due to a timeout, which offers

 * <p>
 * This trait is used by trait <a href="TimeLimitedTests.html"><code>TimeLimitedTests</code></a> to detect exceptions thrown because of timeouts, and
 * for such exceptions, to modify the message to more clearly indicate a test timed out. (Although in its initial
 * release there is only one subclass of <code>TimeoutField</code> in ScalaTest,
 * <a href="TestFailedDueToTimeoutException.html"><code>TestFailedDueToTimeoutException</code></a>,
 * in a future version of ScalaTest, there will be another....)
