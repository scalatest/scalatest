I have checked in the PoC at the following branch:-

https://scalatest.googlecode.com/svn/branches/akka-span-factor 

The overriding is pretty straight forward (though it did take some time for me to read through akka's doc to figure out how to get the akka.test.timefactor correctly):-

import org.scalatest.concurrent.Eventually
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.testkit.TestKitExtension

object AkkaEventually extends Eventually {
  override def spanScaleFactor: Double = TestKitExtension.get(ActorSystem()).TestTimeFactor
}

and the TestTimeFactor is defined in application.conf:-

akka {
  test {
    timefactor = 2.0
  }
}

I have checked in AkkaEventuallySpec that checks the behavior, you can open and run the project using eclipse, with dependency to jars (couldn't find akka maven configuration in their download page) I attached and scalatest 1.8 RC2 that built from to-release-as-1.8 branch.

Hope this helps.

Thanks!

/**
 * Trait providing a <code>scaled</code> method that can be used to scale time
 * <code>Span</code>s used during the testing of asynchronous operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>scaled</code> method allows tests of asynchronous operations to be tuned
 * according to need.  For example, <code>Span</code>s can be scaled larger when running
 * tests on slower continuous integration servers or smaller when running on faster
 * development machines.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>Double</code> factor by which to scale the <code>Span</code>s passed to
 * <code>scaled</code> is obtained from the <code>spanScaleFactor</code> method, also declared
 * in this trait. By default this method returns 1.0, but can be configured to return
 * a different value by passing a <code>-F</code> argument to <a href="../tools/Runner$.html"><code>Runner</code></a> (or
 * an equivalent mechanism in an ant, sbt, or Maven build file).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The default timeouts and intervals defined for traits <a href="Eventually.html"><code>Eventually</code></a> and
 * <a href="AsyncAssertions.html"><code>AsyncAssertions</code></a> invoke <code>scaled</code>, so those defaults 
 * will be scaled automatically. Other than such defaults, however, to get a <code>Span</code>
 * to scale you'll need to explicitly pass it to <code>scaled</code>.
 * For example, here's how you would scale a <code>Span</code> you supply to 
 * the <code>failAfter</code> method from trait <code>Timeouts</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * failAfter(scaled(150 millis)) {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason <code>Span</code>s are not scaled automatically in the general case is
 * to make code obvious. If a reader sees <code>failAfter(1 second)</code>, it will
 * mean exactly that: fail after one second. And if a <code>Span</code> will be scaled,
 * the reader will clearly see that as well: <code>failAfter(scaled(1 second))</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Overriding <code>spanScaleFactor</code></h2>
 * 
 * </p>
 * You can override the <code>spanScaleFactor</code> method to configure the factor by a
 * different means. For example, to configure the factor from Akka
 * TestKit's test time factor you might create a trait like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.concurrent.ScaledTimeSpans
 * import akka.actor.ActorSystem
 * import akka.testkit.TestKitExtension
 *
 * trait AkkaSpanScaleFactor extends ScaledTimeSpans {
 *   override def spanScaleFactor: Double =
 *       TestKitExtension.get(ActorSystem()).TestTimeFactor
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This trait overrides <code>spanScaleFactor</code> so that it takes its
 * scale factor from Akka's <code>application.conf</code> file.
 * You could then scale <code>Span</code>s tenfold in Akka's configuration file
 * like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * akka {
 *   test {
 *     timefactor = 10.0
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Armed with this trait and configuration file, you can simply mix trait
 * <code>AkkaSpanScaleFactor</code> into any test class whose <code>Span</code>s
 * you want to scale, like this:
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class MySpec extends FunSpec with Eventually with AkkaSpanScaleFactor {
 *   // ..
 * }
 * </pre>

   * factor of 1.0 will cause the exact same <code>Span</code> to be returned. A
   * factor of zero will cause <code>Span.ZeroLength</code> to be returned.
   * If overflow occurs, <code>Span.Max</code> will be returned. If underflow occurs,
   * <code>Span.ZeroLength</code> will be returned.
