/*
 * Keeps the main thread from allowing the test threads to execute their bodies
 * until all of them are started, and ready to go. When a test thread is started,
 * it will call increment from its constructor. It then calls decrement from its
 * run method. Test threads are started immediately by the thread() methods, and
 * so this allows the main thread to block until all test threads have started.
 * It does this by calling the waitUntilAllTestThreadsHaveStarted method, which
 * blocks in the wait set if the count is not 0. (The count is only non-zero when
 * one or more test threads have been created but not yet gotten their run methods
 * going.) This is only used for threads started by the main thread. By the time
 * conduct is invoked, all threads started by the main thread will likely have called
 * increment. But just in case, th main thread calling waitUntilAllTestThreadsHaveStarted
 * awaits on a latch that reaches its terminal state only after at least one
 * thread has incremented count. (Increment in this case will be called by the main thread.) After
 * those threads go, they may actually call thread method again, but the main thread
 * will only call waitUntilAllTestThreadsHaveStarted once, so it won't matter. - bv
