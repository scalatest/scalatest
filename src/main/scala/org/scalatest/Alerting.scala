/**
 * Trait that contains the <code>alert</code> method, which can be used to send an alert to the reporter.
 *
 * <p>
 * One difference between <code>alert</code> and the <code>info</code> method of <code>Informer</code> is that
 * <code>info</code> messages provided during a test are recorded and sent as part of test completion event, whereas
 * <code>alert</code> messages are sent right away as <code>AlertProvided</code> messages. For long-running tests,
 * <code>alert</code> allows you to send "alert notifications" to the reporter right away, so users can be made aware
 * of potential problems being experienced by long-running tests. By contrast, <code>info</code> messages will only be seen by the user after the
 * test has completed, and are more geared towards specification (such as Given/When/Then messages) than notification.
 * The difference between <code>alert</code> and <code>update</code> is that <code>alert</code> is intended to be used
 * for warnings or notifications of potential problems, whereas <code>update</code> is just for status updates.
 * In string reporters for which ANSI color is enabled, <code>update</code> notifications are shown in green and <code>alert</code> notifications
 * in yellow.
 * </p>
