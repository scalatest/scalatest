// Note: The reason Tracker is mutable is that methods would have to pass back, and that's hard because exceptions can
// also be thrown. So this mutable object is how methods invoked "returns" updates to the current ordinal whether those
// methods return normally or complete abruptly with an exception. Also, sometimes with closures capturing free variables,
// those free variables may want to grab an ordinal in the context of a callee even after the callee has already called
// some other method. So in other words the calling method may need to know the "current ordinal" even before the method
// it calls has completed in any manner, i.e., while it is running. (The example is the info stuff in FunSuite, which sets
// up an info that's useful during a run, then calls super.run(...).

/**
 * Class that tracks the progress of a series of <code>Ordinal</code>s produced by invoking
 * <code>next</code> and <code>nextNewOldPair</code> on the current <code>Ordinal</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are thread safe. Multiple threads can invoke <code>nextOrdinal</code>
 * and <code>nextTracker</code> concurrently. This facilitates multi-threaded tests that send
 * <code>infoProvided</code> reports concurrently. When using a <code>Dispatcher</code> to execute
 * suites in parallel, the intention is that each <code>Tracker</code> will only be used by one
 * thread. For example, if the optional <code>Dispatcher</code>  passed to <code>Suite</code>'s implementation
 * of <code>runNestedSuites</code> is defined, that method will obtain a new <code>Tracker</code> by invoking
 * <code>nextTracker</code> for each nested suite it passes to the <code>Dispatcher</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param firstOrdinal the first <code>Ordinal</code> in the series of <code>Ordinal</code>s
 *        tracked by this <code>Tracker</code>, which will be used to initialize this <code>Tracker</code>'s
 *        current <code>Ordinal</code>.

   * with the value returned by invoking <code>nextOrdinal</code> on the saved <code>Ordinal</code>, then
