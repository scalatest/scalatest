/**
 * Trait whose instances collect the results of a running
 * suite of tests and presents those results in some way to the user. Instances of this trait can
 * be called "report functions" or "reporters."
 *
 * <p>
 * Reporters receive test results via fifteen events.
 * Each event is fired to pass a particular kind of information to
 * the reporter. The events are:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href="events/DiscoveryStarting.html"><code>DiscoveryStarting</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/DiscoveryCompleted.html"><code>DiscoveryCompleted</code>
 * <li><a href="events/RunStarting.html"><code>RunStarting</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/TestStarting.html"><code>TestStarting</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/TestSucceeded.html"><code>TestSucceeded</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/TestFailed.html"><code>TestFailed</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/TestIgnored.html"><code>TestIgnored</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/TestPending.html"><code>TestPending</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/SuiteStarting.html"><code>SuiteStarting</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/SuiteCompleted.html"><code>SuiteCompleted</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/SuiteAborted.html"><code>SuiteAborted</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/InfoProvided.html"><code>InfoProvided</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/RunStopped.html"><code>RunStopped</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/RunAborted.html"><code>RunAborted</code></a>
 * <li><a href="events/RunCompleted.html"><code>RunCompleted</code></a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Reporters may be implemented such that they only present some of the reported events to the user. For example, you could
 * define a reporter class that does nothing in response to <code>SuiteStarting</code> events.
 * Such a class would always ignore <code>SuiteStarting</code> events.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The term <em>test</em> as used in the <code>TestStarting</code>, <code>TestSucceeded</code>,
 * and <code>TestFailed</code> event names
 * is defined abstractly to enable a wide range of test implementations.
 * Trait <a href="Spec.html"><code>Spec</code></a> fires <code>TestStarting</code> to indicate it is about to invoke one
 * of its tests, <code>TestSucceeded</code> to indicate a test returned normally,
 * and <code>TestFailed</code> to indicate a test completed abruptly with an exception.
 * Although the execution of a <code>Spec</code>'s test methods will likely be a common event
 * reported via the
 * <code>TestStarting</code>, <code>TestSucceeded</code>, and <code>TestFailed</code> tests, because
 * of the abstract definition of &ldquo;test&rdquo; used by the
 * the event classes, these events are not limited to this use. Information about any conceptual test
 * may be reported via the <code>TestStarting</code>, <code>TestSucceeded</code>, and
 * <code>TestFailed</code> events.
 *
 * <p>
 * Likewise, the term <em>suite</em> as used in the <code>SuiteStarting</code>, <code>SuiteAborted</code>,
 * and <code>SuiteCompleted</code> event names
 * is defined abstractly to enable a wide range of suite implementations.
 * Object <a href="tools/Runner$.html"><code>Runner</code></a> fires <code>SuiteStarting</code> to indicate it is about to invoke
 * <code>run</code> on a
 * <code>Spec</code>, <code>SuiteCompleted</code> to indicate a <code>Spec</code>'s
 * <code>run</code> method returned normally,
 * and <code>SuiteAborted</code> to indicate a <code>Spec</code>'s <code>run</code>
 * method completed abruptly with an exception.
 * Similarly, class <code>Spec</code> fires <code>SuiteStarting</code> to indicate it is about to invoke
 * <code>run</code> on a
 * nested <code>Spec</code>, <code>SuiteCompleted</code> to indicate a nested <code>Spec</code>'s
 * <code>run</code> method returned normally,
 * and <code>SuiteAborted</code> to indicate a nested <code>Spec</code>'s <code>run</code>
 * method completed abruptly with an exception.
 * Although the execution of a <code>Spec</code>'s <code>run</code> method will likely be a
 * common event reported via the
 * <code>SuiteStarting</code>, <code>SuiteAborted</code>, and <code>SuiteCompleted</code> events, because
 * of the abstract definition of "suite" used by the
 * event classes, these events are not limited to this use. Information about any conceptual suite
 * may be reported via the <code>SuiteStarting</code>, <code>SuiteAborted</code>, and
 * <code>SuiteCompleted</code> events.
 *
 * <h2>Extensibility</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can create classes that extend <code>Reporter</code> to report test results in custom ways, and to
 * report custom information passed as an event "payload." For more information on the latter
 * use case, see the <em>Extensibility</em> section of the <a href="events/Event.html"><code>Event</code> documentation</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Reporter</code> classes can handle events in any manner, including doing nothing.

   *
   * <p>
   * Prior to ScalaTest 1.5, <code>Reporter</code> extended function type <code>(Event) => Unit</code>.
   * This inheritance relationship was severed in 1.5 to make it possible to implement <code>Reporter</code>s in Java, a request by an IDE
   * vendor to isolate their ScalaTest integration from binary incompatibility between different Scala/ScalaTest releases.
   * To make a trait easily implementable in Java, it needs to have no concrete methods. <code>Reporter</code> itself does not declare
   * any concrete methods, but <code>Function1</code> does.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * This implicit conversion was added in ScalaTest 1.5 to avoid breaking any source code that was actually using
   * <code>Reporter</code> as an <code>(Event) => Unit</code> function. It is unlikely anyone was actually doing that, but if you were
   * and now get the deprecation warning, please email scalatest-users@googlegroups.com if you believe this implicit conversion should
   * be retained. If no one steps forward with a compelling justification, it will be removed in a future version of ScalaTest.
