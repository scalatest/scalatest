   * This trait's
   * implementation of this method returns the fully qualified name of this object's class. 
   * Each suite reported during a run will commonly be an instance of a different <code>Suite</code> class,
   * and in such cases, this default implementation of this method will suffice. However, in special cases
   * you may need to override this method to ensure it is unique for each reported suite. For example, if you write
   * a <code>Suite</code> subclass that reads in a file whose name is passed to its constructor and dynamically
   * creates a suite of tests based on the information in that file, you will likely need to override this method
   * in your <code>Suite</code> subclass, perhaps by appending the pathname of the file to the fully qualified class name. 
   * That way if you run a suite of tests based on a directory full of these files, you'll have unique suite IDs for
   * each reported suite.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * The suite ID is <em>intended</em> to be unique, because ScalaTest does not enforce that it is unique. If it is not
   * unique, then you may not be able to uniquely identify a particular test of a particular suite. This ability is used,
   * for example, to dynamically tag tests as having failed in the previous run when rerunning only failed tests.
   * </p>
   *
   * @return this <code>Suite</code> object's ID.
