/**
 * A <code>Suite</code> class mixing in <a href="SequentialNestedSuitesExecution.html"><code>SequentialNestedSuitesExecution</code></a> that takes
 * zero to many <code>Suite</code>s, which will be returned from its <code>nestedSuites</code> method.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, you can define a suite that always executes a list of
 * nested suites like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class StepsSuite extends Sequential(
 *   new Step1Suite,
 *   new Step2Suite,
 *   new Step3Suite,
 *   new Step4Suite,
 *   new Step5Suite
 * )
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When <code>StepsSuite</code> is executed, it will execute its
 * nested suites in the passed order: <code>Step1Suite</code>, <code>Step2Suite</code>,
 * <code>Step3Suite</code>, <code>Step4Suite</code>, and <code>Step5Suite</code>.
 * Because <code>Sequential</code> extends <code>SequentialNestedSuiteExecution</code>,
 * the distributor passed to <code>runNestedSuites</code> will always be <code>None</code>.
 * So not only will the suites passed to the constructor be executed sequentially, any
 * tests and nested suites of the passed suites will also be executed sequentually.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The difference between <code>Sequential</code> and <a href="Stepwise.html"><code>Stepwise</code></a>
 * is that although <code>Stepwise</code> executes its own nested suites sequentially, it passes
 * whatever distributor was passed to it to those nested suites. Thus the nested suites could run their own nested
 * suites and tests in parallel if that distributor is defined. By contrast, <code>Sequential</code> always
 * passes <code>None</code> for the distributor to the nested suites, so any and every test and nested suite 
 * contained within the nested suites passed to the <code>Sequential</code> construtor will be executed sequentially.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param suitesToNest a sequence of <code>Suite</code>s to nest.
 *
 * @throws NullPointerException if <code>suitesToNest</code>, or any suite
 * it contains, is <code>null</code>.
