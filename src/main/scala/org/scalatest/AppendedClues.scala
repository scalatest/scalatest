/**
 * Trait providing an implicit conversion that allows clues to be placed after a block of code.
 *
 * <p>
 * You can use the <code>withClue</code> construct provided by <code>Assertions</code>, which is
 * extended by every style trait in ScalaTest, to add extra information to reports of failed or canceled tests.
 * The <code>withClue</code> from <code>Assertions</code> places the "clue string" at the front, both
 * in the code and in the resulting message:
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * withClue("This is a prepended clue;") {
 *   1 + 1 should equal (3)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The above expression will yield the failure message:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>This is a prepended clue; 2 did not equal 3</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you mix in this trait, or import its members via its companion object, you can alternatively place
 * the clue string at the end, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * { 1 + 1 should equal (3) } withClue "now the clue comes after"
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The above expression will yield the failure message:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>2 did not equal 3 now the clue comes after</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If no space is already present, either at the beginning of the clue string or at the end
 * of the current message, a space will be placed between the two, unless the clue string
 * starts with one of the punctuation characters: comma (<code>,</code>), period (<code>.</code>),
 * or semicolon (<code>;</code>). For example, the failure message in the above example
 * includes an extra space inserted between <em>3</em> and <em>now</em>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By contrast this code, which has a clue string starting with comma:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * { 1 + 1 should equal (3) } withClue ", now the clue comes after"
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Will yield a failure message with no extra inserted space:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>2 did not equal 3, now the clue comes after</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>withClue</code> method will only append the clue string to the detail
 * message of exception types that mix in the <code>ModifiableMessage</code> trait.
 * See the documentation for <a href="exceptions/ModifiableMessage.html"><code>ModifiableMessage</code></a> for more
 * information.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: the reason this functionality is not provided by <code>Assertions</code> directly, like the
 * prepended <code>withClue</code> construct, is because appended clues require an implicit conversion.
 * ScalaTest only gives you one implicit conversion by default in any test class to minimize the
 * potential for conflicts with other implicit conversions you may be using. All other implicit conversions,
 * including the one provided by this trait, you must explicitly invite into your code through inheritance
 * or an import.
 * </p>

     * character or one of the punctuation characters: comma (<code>,</code>),

     * <pre>
     * 2 did not equal 3, not even for very large values of 1
     * </pre>
