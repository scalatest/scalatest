/**
 * Stackable trait that can be mixed into suites that need code executed before and/or after running each test.
 *
 * <table><tr><td class="usage">
 * <strong>Recommended Usage</strong>:
 * Use trait <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> when you want to stack traits that perform side-effects before and/or after tests, rather
 * than at the beginning or end of tests, or when you need access to the config map or test name in the before and/or after code.
 * <em>Note: For more insight into where <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> fits into the big picture, see the </em>
 * <a href="FlatSpec.html#sharedFixtures">Shared fixtures</a> section in the documentation for your chosen style trait.</em>
 * </td></tr></table>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is composed of the objects and other artifacts (files, sockets, database
 * connections, <em>etc.</em>) tests use to do their work.
 * When multiple tests need to work with the same fixtures, it is important to try and avoid
 * duplicating the fixture code across those tests. The more code duplication you have in your
 * tests, the greater drag the tests will have on refactoring the actual production code.
 * Trait <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> offers one way to eliminate such code duplication:
 * a <code>beforeEach</code> method that will be run before each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>),
 * and an <code>afterEach</code> method that will be run after (like JUnit's <code>tearDown</code>).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatest.examples.flatspec.composingbeforeandaftereach
 * 
 * import org.scalatest._
 * import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * trait Builder extends BeforeAndAfterEach { this: Suite =&gt;
 * 
 *   val builder = new StringBuilder
 * 
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     builder.append("ScalaTest is ")
 *     super.beforeEach() // To be stackable, must call super.beforeEach
 *   }
 * 
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     try {
 *       super.afterEach() // To be stackable, must call super.afterEach
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       builder.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * trait Buffer extends BeforeAndAfterEach { this: Suite =&gt;
 * 
 *   val buffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     try {
 *       super.afterEach() // To be stackable, must call super.afterEach
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       buffer.clear()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * class ExampleSpec extends FlatSpec with Builder with Buffer {
 * 
 *   "Testing" should "be easy" in {
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   it should "be fun" in {
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "clear"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * To get the same ordering as <code>withFixture</code>, place your <code>super.beforeEach</code> call at the end of each
 * <code>beforeEach</code> method, and the <code>super.afterEach</code> call at the beginning of each <code>afterEach</code>
 * method, as shown in the previous example. It is a good idea to invoke <code>super.afterEach</code> in a <code>try</code>
 * block and perform cleanup in a <code>finally</code> clause, as shown in the previous example, because this ensures the
 * cleanup code is performed even if <code>super.afterEach</code> throws an exception.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The main advantage of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> over <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> is that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>.
 * enables trait stacking.
 * The main disadvantage of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> compared to <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> is that <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>
 * requires more boilerplate. If you don't need trait stacking, use <a href="BeforeAndAfter.html"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a> instead
 * of <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>.
 * If you want to make use of test data (the test name, config map, <em>etc.</em>) in your <code>beforeEach</code>
 * or <code>afterEach</code> method, use trait <a href="BeforeAndAfterEachTestData.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEachTestData</code></a> instead.
 * </p>
