 * Implementation trait for class <code>fixture.FunSuite</code>, which is

 * <p>
 * <a href="FunSuite.html"><code>fixture.FunSuite</code></a> is a class,
 * not a trait, to minimize compile time given there is a slight compiler
 * overhead to mixing in traits compared to extending classes. If you need
 * to mix the behavior of <code>fixture.FunSuite</code> into some other
 * class, you can use this trait instead, because class
 * <code>fixture.FunSuite</code> does nothing more than extend this trait.
