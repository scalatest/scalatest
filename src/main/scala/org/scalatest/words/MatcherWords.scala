/*
    In HaveWord's methods key, value, length, and size, I can give type parameters.
    The type HaveWord can contain a key method that takes a S or what not, and returns a matcher, which
    stores the key value in a val and whose apply method checks the passed map for the remembered key. This one would be used in things like:

    map should { have key 9 and have value "bob" }

    There's an overloaded should method on Shouldifier that takes a HaveWord. This method results in
    a different type that also has a key method that takes an S. So when you say:

    map should have key 9

    what happens is that this alternate should method gets invoked. The result is this other class that
    has a key method, and its constructor takes the map and stores it in a val. So this time when key is
    invoked, it checks to make sure the passed key is in the remembered map, and does the assertion.

    length and size can probably use structural types, because I want to use length on string and array for
    starters, and other people may create classes that have length methods. Would be nice to be able to use them.

   * will be invoked on both <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> before comparing them with <em>==</em>. Thus, even though this expression
   * will yield false, because <code>Array</code>'s <code>equals</code> method compares object identity:

   * <p>
   * The following expression will <em>not</em> result in a <code>TestFailedException</code>, because ScalaTest will compare
   * the two arrays structurally, taking into consideration the equality of the array's contents:
   * </p>
   *
   * <pre class="stHighlight">
   * Array(1, 2) should equal (Array(1, 2)) // succeeds (i.e., does not throw TestFailedException)
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>
   * If you ever do want to verify that two arrays are actually the same object (have the same identity), you can use the
   * <code>be theSameInstanceAs</code> syntax.
