java -Dorg.scalatest.BigSuite.size=5 -Dorg.scalatest.SuiteCompletedStatusReporter.max=100 -classpath scalatest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:/usr/artima/scala/lib/scala-library.jar org.scalatest.tools.Runner -c4 -p "scalatest-1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar" -oNCXEHLO -r org.scalatest.SuiteCompletedStatusReporter -s org.scalatest.BigSuite -s org.scalatest.BigSuite -s org.scalatest.BigSuite -s org.scalatest.BigSuite -s org.scalatest.BigSuite

BigSuite.size determines how many suites will be in each BigSuite tree. I haven't taken time to figure out the function, but it looks like this:
size => number of suites in the tree
1 => 2
2 => 5
3 => 16
4 => 65
5 => 326
6 => 1957
7 => 13700

Each -s org.scalatest.BigSuite will create one BigSuite instance using the size specified by the property.

By saying -r org.scalatest.SuiteCompletedStatusReporter, you get a custom reporter that prints out a duration note to the standard output
for every <configurable number> of SuiteCompleted events it receives. It defaults to 10, and can be set via the
-Dorg.scalatest.SuiteCompletedStatusReporter.max=100 setting.

So the knobs we can turn are:

-cN N is the number of threads in the thread pool
-Dorg.scalatest.BigSuite.size=M, M determines the number of suites in the tree via some mysterious function
-s org.scalatest.BigSuite..., repeating this gets you more instances of these trees sized by M
-Dorg.scalatest.SuiteCompletedStatusReporter.max=X, where X is the number of SuiteCompleted events between duration notes
