/**
 * <p>Trait that provides a <code>snap</code> method that takes one or more arguments and results in a
 * <a href="SnapshotSeq.html"><code>SnapshotSeq</code></a>, whose <code>toString</code> lists the names
 * and values of each argument.
 *
 * <p>
 * The intended use case of this trait is to help you write debug and log
 * messages that give a "snapshot" of program state. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; import Snapshots._
 * import Snapshots._
 *
 * scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f)
 * res3: org.scalactic.SnapshotSeq = a was 1, b was 2, c was 3, d was 4, e was null, f was null
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><code>SnapshotSeq</code> offers a <code>lines</code> method that places each variable name/value pair on its own line:<p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f).lines
 * res4: String =
 * a was 1
 * b was 2
 * c was 3
 * d was 4
 * e was null
 * f was null
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or, because a <code>SnapshotSeq</code> is a <code>IndexedSeq[Snapshot]</code>, you can process it just like any other <code>Seq</code>, for example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f).mkString("Wow! ", ", and ", ". That's so awesome!")
 * res6: String = Wow! a was 1, and b was 2, and c was 3, and d was 4, and e was null, and f was null. That's so awesome!
